Exercise: Git Project with WorkProfile
In this exercise you are required to copy the code repository of WorkProfile and make your own version.

1. Fork the WorkProfile repository from https://gitlab.com/training-department/workprofile to your own account in a private repository.
2. Clone your new remote repository to your local machine and run the application.
3. Create a new branch to develop your own version of the application.
For example:  Add a new route to `app.py`:
New "/health" route  the application:


```python
# For simplicity, we're just demonstrating a simple health checks
@app.route("/health")
def health():
    health_messages = []
    
    # Check database connection
    if health_check():
        health_messages.append("Database: Not healthy")
        app.logger.error("Database health check is not OK")

    # Simple application health check
    try:
        # You can include any logic here that verifies the application's health
        app.logger.info("Application is running")
        health_messages.append("Application: Healthy")
    except Exception as e:
        app.logger.error(f"Application health check failed: {e}")
        health_messages.append("Application: Not Healthy")

    combined_health_status = "<br>".join(health_messages)
    return combined_health_status
    ```

5. Re-run WorkProfile and verify the new code works as expected through the app.
6. Commit the changes in your local repository and tag the commit with a version number you see fit.
7. Merge the branch "feature" with "main".
8. Push the new commits and tag to the remote repository.
